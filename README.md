# anton

anton is a CLI chatbot assistant that uses an LLM, code snippets, and its own
REPL + reference syntax.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/elginbeloy/anton.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add your OpenAI API key: `OPEN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

## Usage

To start the chatbot, run the following command:

```
python main.py
```


You will see a prompt that looks like this:
